Repo for Speed Reading Extension for Kindle Cloud Reader

This plugin implements SwirtRead but on the Kindle Cloud Reader pages (since those devs didn't want to figure out the Kindle format).
It extracts the text from the kindle reader page (stored in a weird div), then displays it in the popup. It then pages through the text as required and updates the reading position in Kindle Cloud Reader as well (so when it stops you flip to the correct page where the reading left off).

TODO:
* Update the plugin to handle the new chrome manifest so it begins working in chrome once again and can be uploaded back to chrome extensions.
* Update the plugin with the new Kindle Reader data format and support for graphic novels. The reader can work on some of the books, but more recent kindle releases it's been failing.
